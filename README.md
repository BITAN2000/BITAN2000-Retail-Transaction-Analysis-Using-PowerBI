The Retail Analytics Dashboard offers a bird’s eye view of a company’s retail transaction metrics including Total Revenue, Top Performing 10 Customer, Bottom Performing 10 Customer, Customer purchase trend, Sales by Month, Customer purchase forecast, Drop rate (Customer not active for 3 months). With this dashboard, organizations can make critical decisions to drive their productivity.

The data has been taken from Retail Transaction Dataset of a Company. This dataset consists of two sub datasets namely retail_data_response which contains 2 columns (customer_id and response) with 6884 observations and retail_data_transactions which contains 3 columns (customer_id, trans_amount and trans_date). The dataset has the values of customer’s id, their transaction amount and date and their responses.

**	INFERENCE :-**
We wanted to analyze the key features and trends of the Retail Transaction Dataset of a company based on which we could determine critical decisions to drive their productivity. In my analysis, I have tried to add knowledge about retail transaction statistics.
I tried to forecast the customer purchase trend by analyzing the trend on the basis of top and bottom performing customers, customer’s responses, company’s sales, total revenue and drop rates which will also help the company to know the customer’s interest and trend of purchasing items along with their upcoming responses about different products. 
Actually, customer’s responses are a key element in the success or failure of revenues of a company to meet their objectives. Without an adequate strategy to develop the purchase trend of customers, revenues of a company rapidly stagnate.
